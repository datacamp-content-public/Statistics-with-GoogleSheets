Let's look at how statistics can help us resolve a simple question. We have a sample of 500 loans granted by the LendingClub. The dataset is one of the open source datasets that come from Kaggle.

## The Question

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "9a024e6767"
```

`@part1`
- Do applicants with a bad loan evaluation pay a higher interest rate?


`@script`
The question here is will I pay a higher interest rate for interest rate if my loan grade is below a "C".

`@script`
Here's our data. I have broken the 500 cases in our sample into "high" and "low" scores. Each case is a loan and our data shows the interest rate on that loan.

## Basic Statistics on Interest Rates

`@script`
Our first step in answering this question is to look at the data. What is the mean of interest rates for each type of rating? How many cases fall into each category?
We do this with basic statistics functions. But, first we set up the sheet with names. I have named the set of "High" grade interest rates with the name "High" and the "Low" cases with "Low". Now, let's set up an area with the titles for the counts, etc.
